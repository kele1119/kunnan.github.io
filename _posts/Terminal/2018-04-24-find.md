# 前言


#### SYNOPSIS

```
SYNOPSIS
     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]
     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path [path ...] [expression]

```

#### man find

>*      The options are as follows:

```
PRIMARIES
     All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number to be preceded by a plus sign (``+'') or a minus sign (``-'').  A preceding plus sign means ``more than n'', a preceding minus sign means ``less than
     n'' and neither means ``exactly n''.
 -amin n
             True if the difference between the file last access time and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full minute, is n minutes.
 -mmin n
             True if the difference between the file last modification time and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full minute, is n minutes.
 -name pattern
             True if the last component of the pathname being examined matches pattern.  Special shell pattern matching characters (``['', ``]'', ``*'', and ``?'') may be used as part of pattern.  These characters
             may be matched explicitly by escaping them with a backslash (``\'').
 -size n[ckMGTP]
             True if the file's size, rounded up, in 512-byte blocks is n.  If n is followed by a c, then the primary is true if the file's size is n bytes (characters).  Similarly if n is followed by a scale indica-
             tor then the file's size is compared to n scaled as:

             k       kilobytes (1024 bytes)
             M       megabytes (1024 kilobytes)
             G       gigabytes (1024 megabytes)
             T       terabytes (1024 gigabytes)
             P       petabytes (1024 terabytes)             
```

# EXAMPLES


### 按照文件特征查找

###### -size n[ckMGTP]  
>* find / -size +10000c　
>```
>查找出大于10000000字节的文件(c:字节，w:双字，k:KB，M:MB，G:GB)
>1) Taokeceshiji1:/var/mobile/Library/Preferences root# find / -size +100M
>2)　find / -size -1000k 　　#查找出小于1000KB的文件 
>```
>

######  -group gname

     True if the file belongs to the group gname.  If gname is numeric and there is no such group name, then gname is treated as a group ID.

>* Taokeceshiji1:/var/mobile/Library/Preferences root# find . -group mobile

```
属于 group为mobile 的文件 
```

###### -user uname
             True if the file belongs to the user uname.  If uname is numeric and there is no such user name, then uname is treated as a user ID.

>* Taokeceshiji1:/var/mobile/Library/Preferences root# find / -user  mobile 

```
查找在系统中属于 mobile 这个用户的文件 
```

###### -mmin n、-amin n： 查找在系统中最后n分钟里修改过的文件(modify time)、访问的文件
>* :~ root# find / -amin -1

>* Taokeceshiji1:/var/mobile/Library/Preferences root# find / -mmin -1 
>```
>这个命令我通常用来查看：当我按照一个deb 包之后，对系统修改的文件列表
>```


######      -atime n[smhdw]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the difference between the file last access time and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour period, is n 24-hour peri-
             ods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the difference between the file last access time and the time find was started is exactly n units.  Possible time units are as follows:

             s       second
             m       minute (60 seconds)
             h       hour (60 minutes)
             d       day (24 hours)
             w       week (7 days)

             Any number of units may be combined in one -atime argument, for example, ``-atime -1h30m''.  Units are probably only useful when used in conjunction with the + or - modifier.


>* find / -atime -2　
>```
>　 # 查找在系统中最后48小时访问的文件
```

######      -empty 
    True if the current file or directory is empty.
    
    
>* :/var/mobile/Library/Preferences root# find / -empty 

```
查找在系统中为空的文件或者文件夹
```

###  -name 按照文件名查找 

>* find / \! -name "*.c" -print
> ```
             Print out a list of all the files whose names do not end in .c.
```
>* find /etc -name '*srm*'
>```
>使用通配符*(0或者任意多个)。表示在/etc目录下查找文件名中含有字符串‘srm’的文件
>```
